## Implementation Timeline

| Week | Phase        | Issues | Deliverables                 |
|------|--------------|--------|------------------------------|
| 1    | Foundation   | #1, #2 | Version system, macOS builds |
| 2    | Automation   | #3     | GitHub Actions CI/CD         |
| 3    | Distribution | #4, #5 | Homebrew tap, documentation  |
| 4    | Finalization | #6, #7 | Process docs, v0.1.0 release |

**Total Estimated Time**: 4 weeks

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

### External Dependencies
- GitHub repository with Actions enabled
- Separate repository for Homebrew tap
- macOS systems for testing (Intel and Apple Silicon)
- Linux systems for documentation validation

### Internal Prerequisites
- Core application functionality working
- Basic test suite operational
- Repository properly structured with Go modules

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### macOS Distribution Strategy
1. **Direct Downloads**: GitHub releases with signed binaries
2. **Homebrew**: Custom tap initially, homebrew-core later
3. **Verification**: SHA256 checksums and future code signing

### Linux Distribution Strategy
1. **Source Compilation**: Comprehensive build documentation
2. **Future Considerations**: Package manager integration (apt, yum)
3. **Container Support**: Docker images for consistent builds

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **Homebrew Formula Complexity**: Custom tap setup and maintenance
- **Release Process Reliability**: Automation complexity

### Medium Risk Items
- **Documentation Accuracy**: Platform-specific variations
- **Binary Compatibility**: Different macOS versions
- **Version Management**: Manual tag creation process

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive testing in early phases
- Documentation validation on multiple systems
- Automated testing where possible
- Clear rollback procedures

## Success Metrics

1. **Automated Releases**: Single tag push creates complete release
2. **Installation Success**: 95%+ success rate across platforms
3. **Documentation Quality**: Users can install without support
4. **Distribution Coverage**: Multiple installation methods available
5. **Maintainability**: Clear process for future releases

## Post-Implementation Roadmap

### Short-term (1-3 months)
- Monitor release process stability
- Gather user feedback on installation experience
- Refine documentation based on support requests
- Consider additional package managers

### Medium-term (3-6 months)
- Submit to homebrew-core after maturity
- Investigate Linux package manager integration
- Add automated security scanning
- Consider Windows support (if demand exists)

### Long-term (6+ months)
- Package manager ecosystem expansion
- Release automation improvements
- Binary signing and notarization
- Continuous security monitoring

## Configuration Management

### Version Strategy
- Semantic versioning strictly followed
- Pre-release versions for testing (`v1.0.0-rc.1`)
- Development versions clearly marked
- Changelog automatically generated

### Release Cadence
- **Major releases**: Feature milestones, breaking changes
- **Minor releases**: New features, monthly cadence
- **Patch releases**: Bug fixes, as needed
- **Security releases**: Immediate, as required

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to achieving all release management requirements while establishing sustainable processes for ongoing maintenance and distribution.

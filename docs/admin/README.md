# Admin Documentation

This directory contains documentation for project administration and code maintainers.

This documentation is intended for:
- Project maintainers and contributors
- Code reviewers and release managers
- System administrators deploying Branch Wrangler
- Developers working on the codebase

The admin documentation covers technical implementation details, release processes, development workflows, and maintenance procedures that are not relevant to end users.

For user-facing documentation, see the [`docs/user/`](../user/) directory.
